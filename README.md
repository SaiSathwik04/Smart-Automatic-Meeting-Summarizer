# Smart-Automatic-Meeting-Summarizer

## 🚀 Project Description

Smart Automatic Meeting Summarization is an **AI-powered tool** designed to efficiently process and summarize meeting transcripts. Using advanced **NLP techniques**, it extracts key points, decisions, and action items, making it easier to review and share meeting insights quickly.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Automated Transcript Summarization**: Extracts concise and meaningful summaries from meeting transcripts.
- 🤖 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes NLP techniques to analyze and summarize conversations.
- 🔗 **Flask API**: A lightweight backend to process and return meeting summaries.
- 📄 **Action Item Extraction**: Identifies key decisions and action points from discussions.
- 🏗 **Customizable Model**: Can be fine-tuned for different industries and meeting formats.
- 📂 **GitHub-Compatible Structure**: Uses relative paths for seamless collaboration and deployment.

## 🤖 Model Training & Processing

The summarization process involves training and fine-tuning NLP models. The key steps include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and clean meeting transcript data.
2. **Model Training**: Fine-tune NLP models to enhance summarization accuracy.
3. **Inference & API Deployment**: Use the trained model within the Flask API to generate summaries.
4. **Testing & Optimization**: Improve performance based on feedback and test cases.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with required dependencies:
